 I heard the term ``Quantum Computing'' for the first time at a presentation in the Department of Physics of the University of Coimbra, and the idea of using particles to simulate physical systems and outperform some classical algorithms fascinated me ever since. 

This work is a story of a path started naively our of curiosity for the world around me, a path filled hardships but also ripe with good moments.
This journey was marked by self-doubt, but it was also rich in moments where wonderful travel companions walked alongside giving me strength to carry on. I want to thank all these travel companions.

Namely I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Andreas Wichert, for giving me the freedom to fail and learn from my mistakes, while teaching me how to make Science. 

I would also like to thank my co-workers at Connect Coimbra for teaching me how to balance work and life, and the desire to make a difference in my community.

Last but definitely not the least I give thanks to my loved ones who never ceased supporting me.
