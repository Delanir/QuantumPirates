\section{Thesis Outline}
\label{sec:int_outline}

This document is organized in six main chapters: Introduction, Background, Related Work, Pirate Game, Analysis and Results, and Conclusion. 

In the introductory chapter we lay out our problem, its relevance, the mains objectives of this work.

The second chapter, ``Background'', will pose an overview of theoretical concepts, and definitions needed to understand this work. We will start by making a comparative study between the Classical Probability Theory (Bayesian Probability), and the Quantum Probability (also known as von Neumann Probability). Then we will lay the fundamental concepts needed to work and understand quantum computing, namely the Superposition and Entanglement phenomena, the role of Operators, how to scale quantum systems. Finally we will present a Game Theory background, and some Quantum Game Theory concepts.

After laying the theoretical construct which is the foundation of this work we will analyse some ``Related Work''. In this chapter we select, analyse, and experiment with some Quantum Computing and Quantum Game Theory Models. We tried to privilege a practical approach which might help an unfamiliar reader consolidate some theoretical concepts from the previous chapter. 

In the fourth chapter we present the original Pirate Game and our quantum version, emphasizing our chosen definition of quantum game. 

The fifth chapter will be reserved for analysing and discussing the results captured from the simulation of the Quantum Pirate Game.

Finally we will wrap up this work by reflecting on our principle results, the relevance of this model. We will also try to set new starting points for future work.
