This work marks the end of an arc in a personal story. The story of a path started naively our of curiosity for the world around me, a path filled hardships, a path filled with good momments.

This journey was marked by self-doubt, but it was also rich in moments where wonderfull travel companions walked alongside. I want to thank all these travel companions.
In particular I give thanks to my loved ones who never cessed believing even when I doubted myself.
I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Andreas Wichert, for giving me the freedom to fail and learn from my mistakes, while teaching me the meaning of the word Scientist.
I would also like to thank my co-workers at Connect Coimbra for teaching me how to balance work and life, and the desire to make a difference in my community.
