In this document, we develop a model and we simulate a quantization scheme for the mathematical puzzle created by Omohundro and Stewart - ``A puzzle for pirates ''. This game is a multi-player version of the game ``ultimatum ''.

The Quantum Theory of Games is a field that seeks to introduce the mathematical formalism of Quantum Mechanics in order to explore models of conflict that arise when rational beings make decisions. These models of conflict are pervasive in the structural make-up of our society. The combination of game theory and Quantum Probability, despite not having a practical application, can help in the development of new quantum algorithms. Furthermore the fact that Game Theory is transversal to many areas of knowledge can provide insights to future application of these models.

We focused mainly on the role of quantum entanglement phenomenon in the game system. We found that this phenomenon introduces variations in expected utility by players, for some strategies similar to other models in the area. However we also verified that there are strategies in which there is no interference.
