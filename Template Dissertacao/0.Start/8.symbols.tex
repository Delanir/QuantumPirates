\section{Standard Notation}

$\mathbf{i}$ is the imaginary constant $\sqrt{-1}$.

$e$ is natural constant $2.71828...$

$exp(x)$ is equivalent to $e^{x}$

$\vert x \vert $ represents the absolute value of $x$

$\mathbb{R}$ represents the real numbers.

$\mathbb{C}$ represents the complex numbers.

$P(A)$ represents the probability of an event $A$ occurring.

\section{Sets and Spaces}

$\mathcal{H}^{n}$ represents a $n$-dimension Hilbert Space.

$\mathcal{B} = \{ \vert b_{i} \rangle, i=0, n-1\}$ is a set of orthonormal basis.

\section{Vectors}

$\vert \psi \rangle$ is a quantum state labeled $\psi$ represented by an abstract vector, can also be represented by a $n \times 1$ matrix relative to a basis $\mathcal{B}$.

$\otimes$ represents the tensor product between two vectors.

$ \vert 0 \rangle , \vert 1 \rangle$ are the standard basis for a two-state quantum system (qubit).

\section{Matrices}

$I$ represents a $2 \times 2$ identity matrix.

$\sigma_{x}, \sigma_{y}, \sigma_{z}$ are $2 \times 2$ matrices that form a set known as Pauli Operators.

$C, D$ represent Cooperate and Defect strategies in a game, in a quantum game theory environment they are $2 \times 2$ matrices.

$\rho$ represents a density matrix.

$\mathcal{U}$ is a unitary matrix.

$\mathcal{U}^{-1}$ is the inverse of the unitary matrix $\mathcal{U}$.

$\mathcal{U}^{*}$ is the conjugate of $\mathcal{U}$.

$\mathcal{U}^{T}$ is the transpose of $\mathcal{U}$.

$\mathcal{U}^{\dagger}$ is the conjugate transpose of $\mathcal{U}$.

$\otimes$ represents the Kronecker product between two matrices.


\section{Game Theory}

$\Gamma$ represents a game.

$N$ in a game denotes the number of players.

$u_{i}(A)$ is the expected utility for player $i$ when the outcome $A$ occurs.

$E_{i}$ is utility functional that specifies the expected utility in a quantum game.
