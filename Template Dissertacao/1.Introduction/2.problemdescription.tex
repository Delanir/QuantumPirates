\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:int_problem}

The Pirate Game is a mathematical, Game Theory, problem; with this work want to explore it in the light of quantum game theory. This means developing a quantization scheme, which is a way to transform the original game in a quantum simulation. Our simulations will be implemented on Matlab.

Despite not having a clear ``real-world'' application yet, modelling games with quantum mechanics rules may aid the development of new algorithms that would be ideally deployed using quantum computing. 

Furthermore applying quantum probabilities to a well established area as Game Theory, which has applications in fields such as Economy, Political Science, Psychology, Biology, might introduce new insights and even relevant practical applications\cite{Eisert2008}.
