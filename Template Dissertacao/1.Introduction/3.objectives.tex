\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:int_objectives}

The main objectives with this work are: 

\begin{itemize}
\item To learn how to quantize a classical Game Theory problem;

\item To investigate and compile a set of relevant works on Quantum Models;

\item To compare the Quantum and the Classical versions of a game. Namely to observe how quantum phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, may alter the Nash equilibria in a quantum game.

\end{itemize}
