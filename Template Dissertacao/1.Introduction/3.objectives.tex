\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:int_objectives}

The main objectives with this work are: 

\begin{itemize}
\item To learn how to quantize a classical Game Theory problem;

\item To investigate and compile a set of relevant works on Quantum Models;

\item To observe how quantum phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, may alter the Nash equilibria in a quantum game;

\item To investigate if the Captain in the Pirate Game can approve a voting that would not been able to approve in the classical game. 

\end{itemize}
