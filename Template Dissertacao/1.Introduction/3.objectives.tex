\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:int_objectives}

The main objectives with this work are to learn how to quantize a classical Game Theory problem. We also aim to investigate and compile a set of relevant works on Quantum Models. Moreover we seek to compare the Quantum and the Classical versions of a game. Namely to observe how quantum phenomena, such entanglement, and the usage of quantum strategic space may alter the Nash equilibria in a quantum game.
