\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:int_objectives}

Despite not having a clear ``real-world'' application modelling games with quantum mechanics rules may aid the development of new algorithms that would be idealy deployed using quantum computing. 

Furthermore applying quantum probabilities to a well established area as Game Theory, which has applications in fields such as Economy, Political Science, Psicology, Biology, might introduce new insights and even relevant practical applications\cite{Eisert2008}.
