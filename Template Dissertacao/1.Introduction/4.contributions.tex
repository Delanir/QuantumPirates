\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:int_contributions}

The main contributions expected from this work are:

\begin{itemize}

\item To provide a comprehensive state of the art and related work with examples and executable simulations, in order to facilitate the entry in this field;

\item A Quantum Model of one unique problem, and do a comparative study with the original version. The Pirate Game is an example of a mathematical game that has not been modelled in a quantum domain yet;

\item To study the the possible outcomes, given the initial set-up in a quantum game. Specifically to study the role of entanglement and the emergent results it produces.


\end{itemize}
