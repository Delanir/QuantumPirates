\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:int_contributions}

This dissertation contributes to the area of Quantum Game Theory and Quantum Computing. The main contributions expected from this work are:

\begin{itemize}

\item To provide a state of the art and related work research with examples and executable simulations that could be used to facilitate the entry in this field;

\item The design and simulation of an unique Quantum Model, and a comparative study with the original version. The Pirate Game is an example of a mathematical game that has not been modelled in a quantum domain yet;

\item To study the the possible outcomes, given the initial set-up in a quantum game. Specifically to study the role of entanglement, and the quantum strategies.

\end{itemize}
