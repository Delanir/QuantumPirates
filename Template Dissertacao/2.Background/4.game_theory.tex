\subsection{Zero-Sum Game}
\label{subsec:background:game_theory_zero_sum_game}

A zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a system where the gains are completely evened out by the losses; this means that the sum of the utilities of all players will always be zero.

The definition of Piotr Frackiewicz in Quantum information approach
to normal representation of extensive games proposes a representation
for finite extensive form games. The representation assumes that there
are only two available actions, which can be represented by a qubit.
Those actions could be a yes/no decision or a cooperate/defeat as
those found in many classical game theory problems. A game in this
form is represented by a six-tuple\ref{eq:quantum_game_six_tuple},
where:

\begin{equation}
\Gamma=(\mathcal{H}^{a},\: N,\:\vert\psi_{in}\rangle,\:\xi,\:\{\mathcal{U}_{j}\},\:\{E_{i}\})\label{eq:quantum_game_six_tuple}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item $a$ is the number of actions (qubits), in the game; 
\item $\mathcal{H}^{a}$ is a $a$-dimensional Hilbert space constructed
as $\otimes_{j=1}^{a}\mathbb{C}^{2}$;
\item $\vert\psi_{in}\rangle$ is the initial state of the compound-system
composed by $a$ qubits: $\vert\varphi_{1}\rangle,\:\vert\varphi_{2}\rangle, ..., \vert\varphi_{j}\rangle, ..., \vert\varphi_{a}\rangle$;
\item $\xi$ is a mapping function that assigns each action to a player;
\item For each qubit $j$ $\mathcal{U}_{j}$ is a subset of unitary operators
that can be used by the player to manipulate her qubit;
\item Finally, for each player $i$ $E_{i}$ is a utility functional that
specifies her payoff.\end{itemize}

The strategy of a player $i$ is a map $\tau_{i}$ which assigns a
unitary operator $U_{j}$ to every qubit $j$ that is manipulated
by the player (\inputencoding{latin1}{$j$$\in\xi^{-1}(i)$}\inputencoding{latin9}).
The simultaneous move of the players is represented in \ref{eq:quantum_game_definition_move}.

\begin{equation}
\vert\psi_{fin}\rangle=\otimes_{i=1}^{N}\otimes_{j\in\xi^{-1}(i)}U_{j}\vert\psi_{in}\rangle\label{eq:quantum_game_definition_move}
\end{equation}
