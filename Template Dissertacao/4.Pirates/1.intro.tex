\subsection{Problem Description}
\label{subsec:description}

The Pirate Game is a multiplayer version of the Ultimatum game that is usually stated as follows:

\begin{quotation}
Suppose there are 5 rational pirates: A; B; C; D; E. The pirates have a  loot of 100 gold coins to divide among themselves.


As the pirates have a strict hierarchy, in which pirate A is the captain and E has the lowest rank, the highest ranking pirate alive will propose a division. Then each pirate will cast a vote on whether or not to accept the proposal. 

If a majority or a tie is reached the goods will be allocated according to the proposal. Otherwise the proposer will be thrown overboard and the next pirate in the hierarchy assumes the place of the captain. 

We consider that each pirate privileges her survival, and then will want to maximize the number of coins received. When the result is indifferent the pirates prefer to throw another pirate overboard and thus climbing in the hierarchy. 
\end{quotation}

We can arrive at an equilibrium in this problem by using backward induction.
