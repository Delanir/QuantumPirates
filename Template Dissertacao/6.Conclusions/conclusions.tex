\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:5FutureWork}

The principles of quantum computing provide an extremely rich source of ideas to extend other fields of knowledge.
Some suggestions for possible extensions for this work would be:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{To implement and test this quantum model with human subjects.} The field of Quantum Game theory tries to explain the Human reasoning process by using principles from quantum game theory, namely quantum probabilities. To expose subjects to a quantum model and having them try to take advantage of the rules of the system might provide valuable insights to the way we reason. 
\item \textbf{Increase the number of players.} Studying the quantum system with $8$ players and $1$ gold coin, would be an interesting follow up.
\item \textbf{A graphical user interface (GUI) for the Pirate Game.} This would provide a more approachable way to tweak parameters.
\item \textbf{To build a generic Quantum Game Theory framework.} Although there are already some theoretical frameworks that facilitate the creation of a quantum models of a game theory problem, there is still not a comprehensive .
\item \textbf{To create and structure a platform to promote scientific divulgation of quantum computing.} While investigating and developing this solution, there was often the thought that it would be important for undergraduate Computer Science students to come with contact with this paradigm. This field is still shrouded with mystery to many people, and this makes it a priority topic for scientific divulgation. In this work we tried to present examples that someone with a basic understanding of Algebra may be able to follow, but recollecting my experiences this is by no means enough.
\end{enumerate}
